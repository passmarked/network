A missing `favicon.ico` file can cause massive problems on high traffic sites, as the server has to generate a `404` (or other) response for every request. 

Some browsers (e.g. Firefox) will keep a list of missing favicons, but not all browsers do. Some servers will even go as far as generating a full 404 page for missing resources.  

Having a (cacheable) favicon will prevent this.

_Having a favicon also makes your site stand out more in a users bookmarks list._

# How do I fix this ?

Generate a small (< 10kb), cacheable favicon for your site.
